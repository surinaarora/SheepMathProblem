# SheepMathProblem
Created: November 10, 2023, 2 months into learning how to code
Language: Java 
This project was one of my first math problems solved using the computing skills I had just began to learn, such as importing math class, the main method and creating a class with an appropriate name (basic formatting), incorporating for loops and incrementing values, and using Math.pow to perform basic numeric operations.
